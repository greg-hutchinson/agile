# Product Owner

---
Makes sure that the right things are done!

---
- The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing stories based on the return on investment (ROI).
- The Product Owner will prioritize based on business value first. Once the team adds in the cost, she will prioritize based on ROI.

---
- As Cost goes down, ROI goes up
    - (As Cost → 0  then ROI → ∞)


- Conversely as Cost goes up, ROI goes down
    - As Cost → ∞ then ROI → 0

Roi = Business Value / Cost
