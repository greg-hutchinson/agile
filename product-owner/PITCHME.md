## Makes sure that the right things get done!
- The Product Owner is responsible for prioritizing stories based on the return on investment (ROI).
- The Product Owner will prioritize based on business value first. Once the team adds in the cost, she will prioritize based on ROI.

### As Cost goes down, ROI goes up (As Cost → 0 then ROI → ∞)
#### And conversely
### As Cost goes up, ROI goes down (As Cost → ∞ then ROI → 0)
