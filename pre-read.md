Why is everyone interested in being agile these days when business could survive in the past without ever having heard of the word "agile"?

Stephen Denning the author of "The leaders guide to Radical Management" says that for companies to survive in today's competitive world, they need to focus on "delighting customers". His argument is that companies that just have "happy customers" will not survive the next decade.

Projects in the past have a mediocre at best track record of delighting customers. They are usually delivered late, take very long, sometimes many months, or years and in the end quite often miss the intended outcome, or at least, what was understood to be the intended outcome. Agile mindsets and practices promise to rectify these problems.

During this two day course, you will understand what does it mean to have an agile mindset as well as to understand the basics of operating as a scrum team - one of the most popular agile practices. We will explore the problems of the past poor track record and discuss why having an agile mindset and practices will result in more value delivered more frequently to your customers - thereby delighting them.

I look forward to meeting everyone on Thursday,
... Greg Hutchinson ...
