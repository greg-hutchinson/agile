Why is everyone so interested in being agile these days?  Businesses survived for decades without ever hearing of the word "agile".

Stephen Denning is the author of "The Leaders Guide to Radical Management"; he says that for companies to survive in today's competitive world, they must focus on delighting customers.  His argument is that companies that only have happy customers will not survive the next decade.

In the past, projects had at best a mediocre track record of delighting customers.  They were usually delivered late and took very long (sometimes many months or years).  Ultimately they often missed the intended outcome or what was understood to be the intended outcome.  

Agile mindsets and practices promise to rectify these problems.

During this two day course, you will learn what it means to have an agile mindset, as well as the basics of operating as a scrum team - one of the most popular agile practices.  We will explore the problems of past poor track records, and discuss why using an agile mindset and practices will result in more value delivered more often to your customers, thereby delighting them.

I look forward to meeting you all on Thursday,

Greg Hutchinson
