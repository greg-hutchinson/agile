Why is everyone interested in being agile these days when business could survive in the past without ever having heard the word “agile”?  The answer to this is simple - pace of change. 50 years ago, the pace of change was SLOW – “disruptors” in industries were unheard of because the cost of entry for new companies was high, and customer demands, and expectations were not evolving year-over-year. Once upon a time, being first to market and having a loyal customer base were the two most critical factors to having a successful business.  Fast forward to today’s environment and we’re facing quicker and quicker paces of change, more disruptors, and new and emerging customer needs. Our world is becoming more and more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) which takes away our ability to be able to predict what will be needed and work toward it – instead, companies are finding themselves in a position where they need to be able to react more instantaneously. Agile practices enable companies to adapt more quickly and cheaply by working with smaller increments of work and staying in constant contact with needs of the end user or customer.



3.            Agility – how?

HOW DOES AN ORGANIZATION BECOME AGILE?

Companies who achieve success working in an agile way adopt an agile mindset and start thinking differently. This transition begins with leaders. We need a supportive management layer that is purposeful and conscious about thinking differently about how we approach our work at FCC. We choose this new mindset with the clear target of maximizing the chances of achieving our goals and staying relevant in the marketplace.



WHAT MAKES A MINDSET?

A mindset is a collection of beliefs that shape your thought habits.  They are supported by your values and principles and manifest in the practices, tools and processes you adopt.



WHAT IS THE AGILE MINDSET?

The following diagram outlines the 4 components of the Agile Mindset and how they fit together. In the section below, we’ll discuss each of the 4 sections and what they mean to FCC.



THE AGILE MINDSET IS DESCRIBED BY 4 VALUES

Values are someone’s standards of behavior (or what is important to them). Values affect how you think, what you feel, and what you do.

Understanding agile values are at the core of adopting an agile mindset. The four agile values are:

1.            We put people first before our processes. We care more about the people doing the work than the process itself. We modify the process to make it fit the people, rather than the other way around.

2.            We respond to change over following a plan. We position ourselves so that we are in a constant state of adaptability. Plans have value, but we want to make sure we can adapt to what our customer needs – even if it doesn’t fit into the original plan.

3.            We deliver value early and frequently. We focus on value-add work for our customers. We work on the highest priority item and break it down into small components so that we are getting something of value into the hands of our customers early and frequently.

4.            We collaborate with our customers over negotiating with them. This means that we have engaged customers and we work with them throughout the development of our outcomes. We make sure to get their feedback early and often to ensure that we are truly delivering what the customer needs.



FURTHER DEFINED BY 12 AGILE PRINCIPLES

Principles support and satisfy our values. The agile principles are an extension of our agile values and help shape our agile mindset. Essentially, they are guiding rules that influence how things are done.

- The primary orientation is towards delighting our customers by delivering constant improvements to the customer experience

- The way we work is are highly adaptive and responsive, and change is welcomed

- We iterative value, showing constant progress and creates momentum

4.            Effective cross-functional collaboration throughout the company is critical for success

5.            We build companies with motivated individuals and empower teams to deliver value through a flexible working environment rooted in trust and safety.

6.            Bureaucracy and politics are minimised, co-location and face-to-face communication maximised, wherever possible

7.            Working outputs are the optimum measure of progress and success

8.            Working in an agile manner supports continual and sustainable innovation and progress. Change and iteration is constant, and the pace of progress never slows

9.            Technical excellence and good design are central to maintaining pace and agility and must be left to the knowledge workers to implement.

10.          Simplify, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.

11.          The best results emerge from small teams with a high degree of autonomy

12.          Continuous improvement is achieved through embedded reflection time, and behaviours and culture that support learning



AND FURTHER MANIFESTED THROUGH AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF PRACTICES



A practice is the actions we take and in the realm of “agile” there are many. Most known practices are Scrum and Kanban. These practices (frameworks) are rooted in agile values and principles. A common misnomer is that by adopting these frameworks (typically reserved for IT teams) we are automatically agile. Being agile requires a mindset shift and is for everyone (not just the IT teams).

4. The Agile Leader

WHY DO LEADERS HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY THEY LEAD?

As mentioned already, our world is becoming more and more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) which takes away our ability to be able to predict what will be needed and work toward it. And for this reason, the traditional approach to management needs to change as well. Finding solutions for team, assigning work and setting deadlines are rooted in assuming the problem we are solving is straightforward. Leading with agility means getting comfortable with knowledge workers (the people that know more about the job than the leader and are closest to the work) having the autonomy to self-organize around the problem/the work. A self-organizing team uses working agreements, holds each other to account and achieves their commitments as a team. As such, the role of the leader is to work for and be in service to the team by letting go of the more traditional command and control approach and focus on giving employees an opportunity to grow and continue developing their skills.



                WHAT DOES AGILE LEADERSHIP LOOK LIKE IN PRACTICE?

Agile leadership is very rooted in setting up an environment where the team is trusted, feels safe and can learn, innovate and grow. Rather than directing them, the agile leader empowers, creates focus and actively encourages the team to reflect and improve themselves, their relationships, their work and their process.



Creating focus: Leaders need to orient their team to the work that is important and purposeful while setting priority and allowing them to focus. Setting priority alleviates the impacts of context switching and creates an environment where value can be delivered more frequently, more often. This might mean that we take a less efficient approach to getting work done with a bias towards getting 100% of one thing done instead of advancing all things 10%. This guarantees that we get something to our customer sooner. The rest of the things will come shortly after following this approach.





Continuous improvement: Leaders need to promote a culture of experimentation and approach the teams desire to try something new with a “let’s try it” mentality. For some, saying no or erring on the side of caution is easier, particularly, when we are busy and we’re uncertain of the outcome. Allowing the team to experiment with or try something new will promote trust and safety to the team as well as with the leader.



It is important to create space for the team to retrospect frequently. Some may initially feel like they don’t have time to do so having the encouragement from their leader can go a long way.

Furthermore, creating an environment where employees are not running at 100% capacity is a great way to ensure that they have the time available to do so. Not being 100% utilized also allows time for knowledge sharing with peers as well as space for learning and mastery in their domain.



Empowering teams: Leaders needs to focus more on people management or servant leadership and less on process management (delegating tasks) while truly trusting and empowering them to make decisions specific to their work.  When teams feel empowered there are benefits that occur such as faster problem resolution, higher job satisfaction and improved processes. Micro-managing employees by giving them solutions to implement rather than problems to solve or overruling the decisions made by those closest to the customer can instill a sense of fear or hesitancy. Leaders should mentor and guide employees but allow them to make mistakes.

Empowering a team may feel a little like you no longer have all the answers or are no longer the expert in your domain which can be incredibly uncomfortable for some. However the reality is that the agile leader needs to understand that their role is now to serve first, clear the path, grow people and make the work meaningful. Success for leaders will be defined by how well they are able to do that.

5.  Conclusion

Becoming an agile organization is a journey and FCC has made tremendous progress and is better positioned to pivot and respond to VUCA in our industry than we have ever been. That said, agile is not an absolute term, so there is always more that can be done to improve how we deliver business value to our customers and respond to change in the world. For leaders, having an agile mindset and modelling the agile principles is critical to providing the leadership required in an agile organization.
