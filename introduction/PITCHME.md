## Goals
### And understand the following:
@snap[south span-90 text-08]
- It’s not about being agile for the sake of being agile. It’s about delighting customers.
- Work in progress (WIP) is a liability towards being agile.
- Agile teams aren’t afraid of REWORK.
- Agile Teams are about delivering business value sooner and more frequently. This is not necessarily the most ***efficient*** way to deliver.
- Agile is not an absolute term, rather it is a relative term
- Agile isn’t a thing we do, it’s a mindset.
- Agile delivery minimizes Risk.

- Your task is to find the rule to the list of numbers that I will give you.
- You can ask me only one question - "Is n the next number in this list".
  - However, you can ask this **any number** of times.
- You only get one guess at the rule.
  - If you are right - you win.
  - If not, well ...
- Here is the start of the list:
    - 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

- A lot of these practices came out of the software development realm
- I believe that they can be applied in many areas
- Put into production - means deliver value
- Dev Team - Any team that is delivering value to a customer
