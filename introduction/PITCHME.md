@snap[midpoint span-75]
@ul[list-square-bullets font-concert-one text-08 text-italic text-yellow](true)
- Your task is to find the rule to the sequence of numbers that I will give you.
- You can ask me only one question - "Is n the next number in the sequence".
  - However, you can ask this **any number** of times.
- You only get one guess at the rule.
  - If you are right - you win.
  - If not, well ...
- Here is the sequence:
    - 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

- Put into production - means deliver value.
