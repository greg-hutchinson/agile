## Goals
### And understand the following:
@snap[south span-90 text-08]
- It’s not about being agile for the sake of being agile. It’s about delighting customers.
- Work in progress (WIP) is a liability towards being agile.
- Agile teams aren’t afraid of REWORK.
- Agile Teams are about delivering business value sooner and more frequently. This is not necessarily the most ***efficient*** way to deliver.
- Agile is not an absolute term, rather it is a relative term
- Agile isn’t a thing we do, it’s a mindset.
- Agile delivery minimizes Risk.

## Warmup Exercise
@snap[midpoint span-85]
@ul[list-square-bullets font-concert-one text-08 text-italic text-yellow](true)
- Your task is to identify the rule to the next number in a list of numbers that I will give you.
- You can ask me only one question - "Is n the next number in this list".
- However, you can ask this **any number** of times.
- When you think that you know the rule you can guess - but you only get 1 guess
  - If you are right - you win.
  - If not, well ...
- Here is the start of the list:
    - 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

## Other Comments
@snap[midpoint span-100]
- "Agile Thinking" came out of the software development industry.
- I believe that they can be applied in many areas
- We all deliver value to the end-customer either directly or indirectly.
- You may hear me say - "Go Live" or "put it into production". These terms just mean - deliver value
- Team - Any team that is delivering value to a customer
