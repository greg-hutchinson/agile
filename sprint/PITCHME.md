---
## Sprint Rules
- No “non-delivery team” changes
- Consistent sprint lengths
- Team chooses how to complete stories <br>(by priority)

---
## Why such a short timeframe?
- Highest priority (ROI)
- Reduce risk
  - Risk grows exponentially

- We spent 30 seconds to learn this word.
- We should expect to learn 100 words in 50 minutes.
