## How Does Agile Address this?
@snap[midpoint span-95]
@ul[list-square-bullets text-08 text-italic](true)
- Success is measured by the width of the smile on the Customers face.
  - What about budgets?
- Focus on truly empowering the teams (Mindset shift)
  - Treat software as an asset (Mindset shift)
  - Disney story (parking) Micky Mouse.png (Goofy)
- Focus on Continuous Feedback  
  - This is actually a bigger issue (Complex vs Complicated - Child rearing example)

  Agile Manifesto vs the principals.

# Dev Ops - Self regulating systems (compare dev and maintenance teams)
Verifiable Documentation
- Automation of .... well everything
- Infrastructure as code (Puppet, Chef, Docker)  
- Continuous testing
- Continuous pipelines
- Continuous deployment
- Realtime diagnostics

The Fcc Journey (Case Study)
- A small team was created with 2 agile coaches.
- Sprints
- Success - Why? Customers were delighted
- Trained each team in scrum and that was it. The whole organization bought into it
and we all lived happily ever after. - The End -

We made mistakes
- Needs constant reinforcing / coaching / training
- Created the Agile Center of Excellence (Ace)
  - Dojos.

Mistakes that are commonly made:
- The first thing that everyone adopts is terminology
  - 6 month Sprints
  - Iterations
  - Stand-ups


Wrap-up
- Agile is first and foremost a mindset.
  - You need to buy into that first.
- Agile is not an absolute term.
