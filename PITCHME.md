## Why do we want to be "Agile"?
Before we can answer that, we need to answer this:

## Distinguishing characteristics of these two problem domains
- Complicated problems - Cause and Effect is predictable in advance
- Complex problems - There is a cause and effect but only recognizable in hindsight
---
## The ways that we solve these problems is entirely different
- Complicated problems - Do some analysis, make a plan, execute the plan
- Complex problems - Have an approach, if it works continue to do it, if it doesn't, change something

## The FCC Journey
---
## The FCC Journey
#### Trained each team in scrum and that was it. The whole organization bought into the Agile Mindset and we all lived happily ever after.
<br>- The End -
@img[south-east span-40](assets/img/cinderella.jpeg)
---
### Well... Not Quite.
<br><br>
### We learned some things along the way
---
### What Worked Well
@snap[midpoint span-100 text-08 text-left]
- A small team was created with 2 agile coaches to fix the "amendment problems"
- Successful - Customers were delighted
  - But the bar was pretty low.
- Reorganized much of the department into "product teams"
  - Miminize dependencies and hand-offs between teams
  - Responsible to deliver secure quality solutions
@snapend
---
### Not So Well
@snap[midpoint span-100 text-08 text-left]
- We implemented the terminology first
  - Sprints were every 2 weeks but nothing deliverable
- First delivery was not for 5 months (However, the team thought that they were pretty "Agile")
- Trained subsequent teams, but they needed more coaching
  - Coaches left too soon
@snapend
---
### Created the Agile Center of Excellence (ACE)
@img[midpoint span-60](assets/img/dojo.jpeg)
---
### Summary
- Agile is first and foremost a mindset
- DevOps builds on the Agile practices, but with even more emphasis on automation, to complete the full cycle
- Waterfall approach works better for complicated problems
---
## And Finally ...
If you can look back in 6 months and say<br><br>"We are more Agile today than we were 6 months ago"<br><br>That's progress. Enjoy the journey
