# Refinement
- Get enough detail to understand what is involved in this story to be able to start work
- Try and make the story fit in one sprint
- However, don't call tasks stories just to get something done in a sprint.
- Estimate the story

---
# Planning
- Take your current velocity (in story points)
- pull from the top of the backlog until your velocity is reached.
- if you finish early, pull more stories.

---
# Sprint Start
- List your stories on the sprint board
- Create detailed tasks for everything that is required to complete that story
- Once all the tasks are completed for a story, only then is the story done.
