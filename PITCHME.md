# Why do we want to be "Agile"?
Before we can answer that, we need to answer this:
## What's wrong with our Traditional Approaches?

## How Does an Agile Project Measure Success?

- Success is measured by the width of the smile on the Customers face.

## Agile Teams Focus on Technical Excellence
- Automation is key (Unit Test Cases)
- Refactoring
- Code Review
---
## DevOps takes this even further
- Self regulating systems (compare dev and maintenance teams)
- Verifiable Documentation
- Automation of .... well everything
- Infrastructure as code (Puppet, Chef, Docker)  
- Continuous testing
- Continuous pipelines
- Continuous deployment
- Realtime diagnostics

---
## The Fcc Journey
- A small team was created with 2 agile coaches.
- Success - Why? Customers were delighted
  - But the bar was low. :-)
- Trained each team in scrum and that was it. The whole organization bought into the Agile Mindset and we all lived happily ever after. - The End -

---
## Not Quite
### We made mistakes:
- Adopted scrum first, but didn't focus on the mindset
- Needs constant reinforcing / coaching / training
- Created the Agile Center of Excellence (Ace)
  - Dojos.
---
## Mistakes that are commonly made:
### The first thing that everyone adopts is terminology and ceremony
- 6 month Sprints
- Iterations
- Stand-ups

---
### Summary
- Agile is first and foremost a mindset.
- Agile is not an absolute term
- Waterfall can work but works better for complex problems
- Focus on truly empowering the teams (Mindset shift)
- Treat software as an asset (Mindset shift)
- Disney story (parking) Micky Mouse.png (Goofy)
- Focus on Continuous Feedback  
- This is actually a bigger issue (Complex vs Complicated - Child rearing example)
