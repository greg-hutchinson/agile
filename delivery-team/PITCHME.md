Note:
Robert Yerkes (1907) [American psychologist] reported, "Anxiety improves performance until a certain optimum level of arousal has been reached. Beyond that point, performance deteriorates as higher levels of anxiety are attained."[5] Beyond the optimum performance zone, lies the "danger zone" in which performance declines rapidly under the influence of greater anxiety.

Note:
“Stress kills innovation, as does busyness” [Tom DeMarco]
Putting people under pressure means they will do as told, not thinking about the why (and possibly innovate better ways)
Do not focus foremost on utilization and efficiency of resources in complex environments!
