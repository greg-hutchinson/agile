## Scrum Theory
// @snap[midpoint span-100 text-07]
- Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory
- Scrum uses an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
- Empirical process control is upheld by 3 pillars:
    - Transparency â€“ the process must be visible to all
    - Inspection â€“ Scrum artifacts must be frequently inspected as well as the progress towards the Sprint goal
    - Adaptation â€“ if the process is deviating outside of acceptable limits, and the product will be unacceptable, the process must be adjusted.
