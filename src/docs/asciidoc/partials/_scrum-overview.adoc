## Scrum Theory

- Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory
- Scrum uses an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.
- Empirical process control is upheld by 3 pillars:
    - Transparency – the process must be visible to all
    - Inspection – Scrum artifacts must be frequently inspected as well as the progress towards the Sprint goal
    - Adaptation – if the process is deviating outside of acceptable limits, and the product will be unacceptable, the process must be adjusted.
