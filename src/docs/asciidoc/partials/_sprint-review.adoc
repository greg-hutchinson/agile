Demo of the increment:
	The demo is a largest part of the sprint review. Done – feedback
	Stakeholder language – problems solving and how we solved
	The demo is the truest form of status and therefore a great form of governance. (Watermelon reporting)
Talk about what else was worked on (and maybe remains unfinished)
Discuss upcoming iterations
Know your audience ... Don’t kill ppl with technical details. Focus on the value
When: At the end of each sprint
