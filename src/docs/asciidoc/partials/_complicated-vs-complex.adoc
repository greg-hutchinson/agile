## Complicated Vs. Complex

## The Cynefin Framework
It is a sense making framework to help:

- Decide what type of problem you are trying to solve
- Decide which approach you should take to solve the problem.

## Ordered Systems
Simple and Complicated

[.columns]
## Simple Domain
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Observable in advance
- Obvious to everyone
- Best practice

[.columns]
## Complicated Domain
// 
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Observable in advance
- However, needs Analysis or expertise
- Good practice

## Unordered Domains
Complex and Chaotic

[.columns]
## Complex Domain
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Only observable in hindsight
- Don't use Fail-safe design rather safe-fail experiments
- Emergent practice

## Distinguishing characteristics of these two problem domains
- Complicated problems - Cause and Effect is predictable in advance
- Complex problems - There is a relationship between cause and effect but it is only recognizable in hindsight

[.columns]
## Different approach to solve these problems
- Complicated problems - Do some analysis, make a plan, execute the plan
- Complex problems - Have an approach, if it works continue to do it, if it doesn't, change something

Which is Complex? Complicated?

## Expertise

a| image::alex-steph.jpg[AS, 320,240] a| image::rocket.png[Rocket, 320,240]
|Expertise can contribute but is neither necessary nor sufficient to assure success |High levels of expertise in a variety of fields are necessary for success
|===

## Formulas

|Formulas have limited application |Formulas are critical and necessary
|===

## Experience

[grid=none]
|===
a| image::alex-steph.jpg[AS, 320,240] a| image::rocket.png[Rocket, 320,240]
|Raising one child provides experience but no assurance of success with the next |Sending one rocket increases assurance that the next will be OK
|===

## Relationships
[frame=none]
[grid=none]
|===
a| image::alex-steph.jpg[AS, 320,240] a| image::rocket.png[Rocket, 320,240]
|Every child is unique and must be understood as an individual - relationships are important. |Rockets are similar in critical ways.
