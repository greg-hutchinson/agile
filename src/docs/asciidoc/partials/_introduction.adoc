## Goals
## And understand the following:
// @snap[south span-90 text-08]
- Itâ€™s not about being agile for the sake of being agile. Itâ€™s about delighting customers.
- Work in progress (WIP) is a liability towards being agile.
- Agile teams arenâ€™t afraid of REWORK.
- Agile Teams are about delivering business value sooner and more frequently. This is not necessarily the most ***efficient*** way to deliver.
- Agile is not an absolute term, rather it is a relative term
- Agile isnâ€™t a thing we do, itâ€™s a mindset.
- Agile delivery minimizes Risk.

## Warmup Exercise
// @snap[midpoint span-85]
[%step]
- Your task is to identify the rule to the next number in a list of numbers that I will give you.
- You can ask me only one question - "Is n the next number in this list".
- However, you can ask this **any number** of times.
- When you think that you know the rule you can guess - but you only get 1 guess
  - If you are right - you win.
  - If not, well ...
- Here is the start of the list:
    - 2, 4, 6, 8, ...
