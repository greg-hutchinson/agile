# Building Paper Airplanes

[.columns]
## Rules and Constraints
[.smaller-bullet]
- ¼ of a sheet of paper (paper must be cut in 4)
- Only one fold at a time per team member
- Only the Product Owner tests
    - Airplane must fly 3 meters by aerodynamic lift
    - Airplanes may only be tested once
- Report results at the end of each iteration
    - Airplanes built
    - Airplanes tested successfully
    - Work in Progress (Airplanes not completed)

- Partially built planes must be discarded after each iteration

Activity key learnings:
Taking time to retrospect allows us to inspect and adapt our processes frequently
Small incremental changes over time add up to big results
Making small changes allows us to fail and recover quickly

Debrief questions:
What did you change after the 1st and 2nd rounds, did you focus on process or design? Were you happy with the results?
Not many companies would encourage teams to take an hour every 2 weeks to review their processes – we’re very lucky at FCC that this practice is supported and encouraged – take advantage of it.
