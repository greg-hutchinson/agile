## Review?
// @snap[south span-90 text-08]
- Itâ€™s not about being agile for the sake of being agile. Itâ€™s about delighting customers.
- Work in progress (WIP) is a liability towards being agile.
- Agile teams arenâ€™t afraid of REWORK.
- Agile Teams are about delivering business value sooner and more frequently. This is not necessarily the most ***efficient*** way to deliver.
- Agile is not an absolute term, rather it is a relative term
- Agile isnâ€™t a thing we do, itâ€™s a mindset.
- Agile delivery minimizes Risk.
