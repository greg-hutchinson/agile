## Worst thing a Product Owner can say.
[%step]
[quote, Any Product Owner]
I'll add it to the backlog

## Discussion - How Big are Your Stories
[%step]
* Remember - it's all about delighting customers
* Customers don't mind waiting for small, medium or large stories.
* What do they really mind waiting for?

## Some Stories should never hit the backlog

## Notes Worth Mentioning
* A large backlog of more than ~ 6 months is useless.
* If you have trouble dealing with that use your technology to hide the fact.
** automatically move them to a very low status and then later have them automatically deleted.



## ROI Calculation

ROI = BusinessValue / Cost

For the Mathematicians in the crowd +
As Cost goes down, ROI goes up + 
(As Cost → 0 then ROI → ∞) 

And conversely +
As Cost goes up, ROI goes down +
(As Cost → ∞ then ROI → 0)

## Product Owner Other Responsibilities
- Maintains and grooms the product backlog
- Make sure the team understands what the criteria is for deciding between stories
- Runs the refinement
