## Scrum Overview
video::TRcReyRYIMg[youtube]


## Story
* Outcomes not outputs
* Are the requirements that go into the product Backlog
* Are recognizable as providing value by your customer
* Are deliverable by themselves
* Exist in the Product/Sprint backlog
* Consist of other tasks

## Refinement
* Discuss the stories to the level that the team understands what the problem is.
* This is different for each team, depending on skillset, experience etc.
** And quite often on the experience of the PO.


## Discussion - Definition of done
* What is your definition of done? After testing, into production?, PO is happy?
* This is always controversial.


## Definition of done
* When all the tasks identified for the story are completed.
* This means that ....

## First things first
[disc]
* When you accept a story into a sprint, you must: 
** identify all the tasks to complete
** If these tasks are bigger than a week, then
*** break it down into sub-task
* If the story is large you may have to iterate on this step

## Exercise 
We are having a party at your/my place in 3 hours with appetizers as the only food.
Guests have already been invited and have also been asked to bring one appetizer each.
What do we have to do, to have a successful party?


## Retrospective 
What is the purpose of the retrospective?


## Focus
Assuming that you have 10 stories to finish +
Are these 2 statements equal?

* 100% of 8 things 

or

* 80% of 10 things

Both are 80% correct? What's the difference?

* a specific way of delivering solutions
* a framework or process
* a methodology


It's a way of ***being***
