## The Cynefin Framework
### It is a sense making framework to help:
- Decide what type of problem you are trying to solve
- Decide which approach you should take to solve the problem.

## Ordered Systems

Simple and Complicated

---
## Simple Domain
@snap[east span-20 text-06 text-center]
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Observable in advance
- Obvious to everyone
- Best practice
@snapend

## Complicated Domain
@snap[east span-20 text-06 text-center]
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Observable in advance
- However, needs Analysis or expertise
- Good practice

## Unordered Domains

---
## Complex Domain
@snap[east span-20 text-06 text-center]
- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Only observable in hindsight
- Don't use Fail-safe design rather safe-fail experiments
- Emergent practice

## Distinguishing characteristics of these two problem domains
- Complicated problems - Cause and Effect is predictable in advance
- Complex problems - There is a relationship between cause and effect but it is only recognizable in hindsight
---
## Different approach to solve these problems
- Complicated problems - Do some analysis, make a plan, execute the plan
- Complex problems - Have an approach, if it works continue to do it, if it doesn't, change something

Which is Complex? Complicated?

---
## Expertise
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
@img[span-50](assets/img/alex-steph.jpg)
Expertise can contribute but is neither necessary nor sufficient to assure success.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
High levels of expertise in a variety of fields are necessary for success.
---
## Formulas
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
@img[span-50](assets/img/alex-steph.jpg)
Formulas have limited application.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Formulas are critical and necessary.

---
## Experience
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
@img[span-50](assets/img/alex-steph.jpg)
Raising one child provides experience but no assurance of success with the next.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Sending one rocket increases assurance that the next will be OK.

---
## Relationships
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
@img[span-50](assets/img/alex-steph.jpg)
Every child is unique and must be understood as an individual â€“ relationships are important.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Rockets are similar in critical ways.

---
## Outcome
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
@img[span-50](assets/img/alex-steph.jpg)
Uncertainty of outcome remains.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
There is a high degree of certainty of outcome.
