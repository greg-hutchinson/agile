- Relationship exists between cause and effect
- Observable in advance
- Obvious to everyone
- Best practice

## Expertise

![](assets/img/child.jpg)
Expertise can contribute but is neither necessary nor sufficient to assure success.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
High levels of expertise in a variety of fields are necessary for success.
---
## Formulas
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
![](assets/img/child.jpg)
Formulas have limited application.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Formulas are critical and necessary.

---
## Experience
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
![](assets/img/child.jpg)
Raising one child provides experience but no assurance of success with the next.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Sending one rocket increases assurance that the next will be OK.

---
## Relationships
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
![](assets/img/child.jpg)
Every child is unique and must be understood as an individual â€“ relationships are important.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
Rockets are similar in critical ways.

---
## Outcome
@snap[west text-07 span-50 text-left ]
![](assets/img/child.jpg)
Uncertainty of outcome remains.
@snapend
@snap[east text-07 span-46 text-left ]
![](assets/img/rocket.png)
There is a high degree of certainty of outcome.
