Why is everyone interested in being agile these days? Businesses have been able to succeed in the past without ever hearing the word “agile”. Fifty years ago, being first in the market and having an established loyal customer base were the two most critical criteria to having a successful business. This, coupled with the pace of change being slow and most companies being able to easily predict trends in the industry (and if they were wrong, they still had a lot of time to adapt their plan) made for a much different landscape than the one we are currently living in.

Today we are faced with a much quicker pace of change that takes away the ability to predict trends. Our world is becoming more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA). Years ago, having an established “foot in the door” was a huge advantage. The cost of entry for new competitors was high (infrastructure, staff, inventory, etc), but this isn’t the case anymore. New competitors are much leaner and nimble.  

Since we can’t rely too heavily on our predication of the future, how do we ensure that our companies stays relevant? We believe the key risk mitigator to our current VUCA landscape is to be able to adapt quickly and cheaply to whatever comes our way.
