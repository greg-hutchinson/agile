Why is everyone so interested in being agile and DevOps these days?  Businesses survived for decades without ever hearing either of these words.

Stephen Denning is the author of "The Leaders Guide to Radical Management"; he says that for companies to survive in today's competitive world, they must focus on delighting customers.  His argument is that companies that only have happy customers will not survive the next decade.

In the past, projects had at best a mediocre track record of delighting customers.  They were usually delivered late and took very long (sometimes many months or years).  Ultimately they often missed the intended outcome or what was understood to be the intended outcome.  

During this 1 hour presentation, Greg will describe how Agile and DevOps principles aim to solve these problems followed by real life account of what has and has not worked at Farm Credit Canada.
