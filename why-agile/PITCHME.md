## What went wrong?

---
## Traditional Software Projects
@snap[midpoint span-80 text-center]
@ul[list-square-bullets list-hide-fragments]
- Very long (1 to 7 years)
- Large learning curves
- Many features are implemented incorrectly or are missed
- Stressful for everyone
- Expensive

## Next Approach
### We thought it was a lack of analysis.
@snap[midpoint span-100 text-center]
@ul[list-square-bullets list-hide-fragments]
- Did more analysis
- Project took even longer
- Exact same results
- **Madness**

## What did we notice?
@snap[north span-100 text-left text-09]
<br><br>
- We had very unhappy customers.
- Planning and design phases were time consuming and added little value (as a deliverable) by themselves.
- It changed the customers' behaviour.
